the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so i try to ignore it).	service	negative
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	service	negative
she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	service	negative

any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	service	negative
when we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	service	negative
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	service	negative
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.	service	negative
the manager continually interrupted with "is there anything else i can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.	service	negative
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	service	negative
in short, schooner or later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	service	negative
