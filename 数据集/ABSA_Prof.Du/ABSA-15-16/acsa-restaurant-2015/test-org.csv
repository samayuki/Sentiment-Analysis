It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.	ambience general	positive
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	ambience general	neutral

How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.	restaurant general	negative

Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.	food prices	negative
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.	food quality	positive

It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 	restaurant prices	negative
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	food quality	positive

As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	restaurant miscellaneous	negative

The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	service general	negative
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??	service general	negative
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	service general	negative
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 	service general	negative
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	service general	negative
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	service general	negative
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 	restaurant prices	negative

Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"	service general	negative
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	food quality	positive

While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	drinks quality	positive
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.	service general	negative
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	service general	negative
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.	service general	negative
If you go here, do it on his off-night.	service general	negative
Best meal in a long time!	food quality	positive
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.	food quality	positive

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level	food quality	positive
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.	food quality	positive

Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	ambience general	negative

Don’t go to this place!	restaurant general	negative
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.	restaurant general	negative
Appetizers took nearly an hour.	service general	negative
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	service general	negative
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.	service general	negative
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	service general	negative
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	service general	negative
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.	service general	negative
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	restaurant prices	negative

There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.	food quality	negative

On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.	service general	negative
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.	service general	negative

I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.	restaurant general	negative
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.	service general	negative
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.	service general	negative
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.	service general	negative
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."	service general	negative
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.	service general	negative
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.	restaurant miscellaneous	negative
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.	service general	negative

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.	service general	negative
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	service general	negative
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	service general	negative
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	service general	negative
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	service general	negative
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	service general	negative
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	restaurant general	negative
